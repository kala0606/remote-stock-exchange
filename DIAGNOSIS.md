# Server Issue Diagnosis and Fix

## Problem
Players were experiencing "Room not found" errors when trying to join rooms, often requiring 10+ attempts before successfully joining.

## Root Cause Analysis

### ‚ùå What Was NOT the Problem
- **The ping mechanism is NOT the issue**
  - The client pings every 25 seconds to keep connections alive
  - The server responds with a simple pong
  - This is a standard keep-alive mechanism and doesn't cause restarts

### ‚úÖ What WAS the Problem
The issue was with the **Fly.io health check configuration**:

1. **Health Check Endpoint**: 
   - Was using `/api/status` which performs complex operations (iterates through all games, creates detailed responses)
   - This endpoint could be slow or timeout under load
   - Timeout was set to only 5 seconds

2. **Server Restart Behavior**:
   - When health checks fail, Fly.io restarts the server
   - Server restarts wipe the in-memory `games` object
   - When players try to join a room that was just created, it no longer exists!

3. **Timing Issue**:
   - Admin creates room (stored in memory)
   - Health check fails ‚Üí server restarts
   - Player tries to join ‚Üí room is gone
   - Result: "Room not found" error

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Changed Health Check Endpoint
```toml
# Before
path = "/api/status"  # Complex endpoint

# After  
path = "/health"      # Simple endpoint
```

The `/health` endpoint is much simpler and faster:
```javascript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
});
```

### 2. Increased Health Check Tolerances
```toml
# Before
grace_period = "10s"
timeout = "5s"

# After
grace_period = "30s"  # More time before considering server unhealthy
timeout = "10s"       # More time for response
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Server startup/shutdown events with timestamps
- Room creation with socket IDs
- Join attempts and failures
- Available rooms at any point
- Server uptime when issues occur

This will help identify if restarts are still occurring.

## Expected Result
- Health checks should no longer cause unnecessary server restarts
- Rooms should persist between player join attempts
- "Room not found" errors should be eliminated
- Players should be able to join on first attempt

## How to Verify the Fix
1. Deploy the updated code to Fly.io
2. Monitor the logs for any server restart messages
3. Test room creation and joining
4. Check logs show `[CREATE_ROOM]` and `[JOIN_ROOM]` events without restarts between them

## Next Steps
After deploying:
- Monitor Fly.io logs for the enhanced logging output
- Look for any "üöÄ SERVER STARTING" or "‚ö†Ô∏è SIGTERM/SIGINT" messages indicating restarts
- Verify players can join rooms consistently

## Files Modified
- `fly.toml` - Updated health check configuration
- `server.js` - Enhanced logging for diagnostics
