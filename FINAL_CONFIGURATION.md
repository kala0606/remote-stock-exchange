# Final Balanced Configuration

## The Problem

You were caught between two issues:
1. **2 machines** → Players couldn't join rooms ("room not found" errors)
2. **1 machine** → Game disconnections during play

## The Solution: Optimized Single Machine

### Current Configuration

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Machines** | 1 (max = 1) | No "room not found" errors - all players connect to same instance |
| **RAM** | 1GB | Enough for multiple game rooms without running out of memory |
| **CPUs** | 1 shared | Sufficient for game logic and Socket.IO connections |
| **Auto-stop** | Disabled | Game won't disconnect during play |
| **Health checks** | Every 60s | Less aggressive - won't trigger unnecessary restarts |

### What We Fixed

#### 1. ✅ Multiple Machines Issue (Root Cause of "Room Not Found")
- **Before**: 2 machines, each with separate memory
- **After**: 1 machine with `max_machines_running = 1`
- **Result**: All players see the same game rooms

#### 2. ✅ Health Check Failures (Caused Restarts)
- **Before**: Checked `/api/status` (complex) every 30s with 5s timeout
- **After**: Check `/health` (simple) every 60s with 15s timeout
- **Result**: Server doesn't restart unnecessarily

#### 3. ✅ Memory Issues
- **Before**: 512MB (too little) or 2GB (too expensive)
- **After**: 1GB (sweet spot)
- **Result**: Enough for games without excessive cost

#### 4. ✅ Removed Ping Mechanism
- **Before**: Client pinged every 25s (kept server awake)
- **After**: Pings removed
- **Result**: Lower resource usage, but auto-stop is disabled anyway

## Cost Estimate

**Free tier includes**: 768MB RAM across 3 VMs

**Your usage**: 1GB RAM, 1 CPU, always running

**Expected cost**: ~$7-10/month

- Fly.io charges approximately $0.0000008/GB-sec
- 1GB × 2,592,000 seconds/month ≈ $2-3/month for RAM
- Plus CPU time ≈ $5-7/month
- **Total: $7-10/month**

This is **60% cheaper** than the 2GB/2CPU setup (~$15-20/month)

## Why This Should Work

### No More "Room Not Found" ✅
- Single machine = single source of truth
- All players connect to the same server instance
- Rooms persist as long as the machine runs

### No More Disconnections During Games ✅
- 1GB RAM is enough for your game (you were running it before)
- `auto_stop_machines = false` means it won't stop during play
- Better health checks prevent unnecessary restarts
- Socket.IO keeps connections alive

### What Could Still Cause Issues?

1. **Deployments**: When you deploy, the machine restarts and all games are lost
   - **Solution**: Only deploy when no games are active
   
2. **Memory Leaks**: If your code has memory leaks, the machine might crash after long uptime
   - **Monitor**: Check `fly logs` for memory warnings
   
3. **Network Issues**: Players with bad internet may still disconnect
   - **Not server-side**: Can't fix this from the server

4. **Fly.io Outages**: Rare but possible
   - **No control**: Infrastructure issues

## Monitoring Your Setup

### Check Machine Status
```bash
fly status
```

### Check Logs (for errors or restarts)
```bash
fly logs
```

### Check Memory Usage
```bash
fly status --json | grep memory
```

### Manual Machine Control (if needed)
```bash
# Restart the machine
fly machine restart 784964dc346428

# Check machine details
fly machine status 784964dc346428
```

## If You Still Get Disconnections

If games still disconnect, it's likely:

### Option A: Increase Resources
```bash
# Edit fly.toml:
[[vm]]
  memory = '2gb'
  cpus = 2
  
# Then deploy
fly deploy
```
Cost: ~$15-20/month

### Option B: Implement Redis (Best Long-term Solution)
This allows:
- Multiple machines for reliability
- No data loss on restarts
- Horizontal scaling

**Pros**: 
- Rooms persist across restarts
- Can scale to 2+ machines
- Professional solution

**Cons**: 
- Requires significant code changes
- Need to add Redis (adds cost ~$5-10/month)
- More complexity

I can help implement Redis if you want the most robust solution.

## Quick Reference

### Current Setup
- **URL**: https://remote-stock-exchange.fly.dev
- **Machine ID**: 784964dc346428
- **Region**: bom (Mumbai)
- **Config**: 1GB RAM, 1 CPU, always-on

### Files Modified
- `fly.toml` - Balanced configuration
- `server.js` - Better error handling, removed ping
- `public/client.js` - Removed ping mechanism

## Next Steps

1. **Test it now**: Try creating a room and having players join
2. **Play a full game**: See if disconnections still occur
3. **Monitor costs**: Check Fly.io billing after a few days
4. If still having issues, we can implement Redis for a proper multi-machine setup
